Minebike was my Master's thesis project that aims to motivate physical exercise among the pediatric population especially children that ages between 10 to 15. Through the combination of exercise and gaming, the game was able to attract attentions of the teenagers through exergaming.

My major row in this project is to implement an AI system that can adjust the levels of difficulty for patients with various physical conditions.
