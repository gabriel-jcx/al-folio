 I am currently a Ph.D. student under the supervision of [Dr. Fernando A. Kuipers](https://fernandokuipers.nl){:target="\_blank"} and [Prof. dr. Koen Langendoen](https://www.st.ewi.tudelft.nl/koen/){:target="\_blank"} at the [Embedded and Network Systems](https://www.tudelft.nl/ewi/over-de-faculteit/afdelingen/software-technology/embedded-and-networked-systems){:target="\_blank":} of the [EEMCS](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/eemcs){:target="\_blank"}  department, [Delft University of Technology](https://tudelft.nl){:target="\_blank"}.

 In 2019, I received my Master's degree in Computer Engineering at the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, [Univeristy of California, Irvine](https://www.uci.edu/){:target="\_blank"}. I received my Bachelor's degree also in Computer Engineering with Cum Laude at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, [Univeristy of California, Santa Cruz](https://www.ucsc.edu/){:target="\_blank"} in 2017.  

 

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com){:target="\_blank"}. You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/){:target="\_blank"} and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/){:target="\_blank"}, like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
